4. **Open the project in your browser:**

    Start your web server and navigate to `http://localhost/calculator` (or the appropriate directory if you're using a different server setup).

## Usage

### JavaScript Functions

- **Addition:** `add(a, b)`
- **Subtraction:** `subtract(a, b)`
- **Multiplication:** `multiply(a, b)`
- **Division:** `divide(a, b)`
- **Remainder:** `remainder(a, b)`
- **Average:** `average(numbersArray)`
- **Exponential:** `exponential(base, exponent)`
- **Rectangle Area:** `rectangleArea(length, width)`
- **Triangle Area:** `triangleArea(base, height)`
- **Circle Area:** `circleArea(radius)`
- **Fibonacci Sequence:** `fibonacci(n)`
- **Factorial:** `factorial(n)`
- **Quadratic Equation Solver:** `quadratic(a, b, c)`

### PHP Functions

The PHP functions mirror the JavaScript functionality. You can call the PHP functions from your server-side scripts.
